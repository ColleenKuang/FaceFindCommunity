## Brief Introduction

`FaceFindCoummunity` is web-app to guide students to choose more apporpiate student communities in UIC.

The app is divided into two parts.

The first part called `face recognition`. In this part, users would be asked for uploading their own photo. After analyzing their face by Microsoft Azure Face REcognition API, a report will give at the bottom of the screen. It is kind of 'surprise me' functionality, just for kidding and promption.

The second part called `Community Personality Test`. Users are going to do multiple choices among serverl designed questions. Finally, the app will show data chart about their community personality, and recommend some communites based on the result.
